### üìÇ Featured Project: ITECH1502 Final Project

#### Forensic Log Analysis of a Web Application Breach (TryHackMe: Juicy Details)

This project simulates a real-world incident response scenario where I acted as a SOC Analyst to investigate a security breach using only server log files.

*   **Objective:** To analyze `access`, `auth`, and `FTP` logs to identify the attacker's tools, exploited vulnerabilities, and exfiltrated data.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:**
    *   **Log Analysis:** Used command-line tools (`grep`) to parse thousands of log entries for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
    *   **Threat Identification:** Identified signatures of tools like Nmap, Hydra, SQLmap, and Feroxbuster.
    *   **Incident Timeline Construction:** Correlated events across multiple log sources to build a step-by-step narrative of the attack.
*   **Outcome:** Successfully identified the entire attack chain, from initial reconnaissance to the theft of user credentials and sensitive files.
